# FRA Hedging Simulator

## 🎯 Objective
This project simulates the use of Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs) as a hedging tool against interest rate fluctuations. The goal is to model the P&L impact of hedging a floating-rate exposure with a FRA under different interest rate scenarios.

## 🧠 Key Concepts
- FRA pricing and payoff mechanics
- Floating rate liabilities (e.g., 3M LIBOR/EURIBOR)
- Cost of carry and risk-neutral vs real-world rate paths
- Comparison between hedged and unhedged exposures

## 🛠️ What You'll Find Here
- A simulation engine using Python to generate interest rate paths
- FRA pricing logic based on market conventions
- P&L impact visualization under multiple scenarios
- Sensitivity analysis and performance metrics

## 🔧 Next Steps
- [ ] Build rate simulation module
- [ ] Implement FRA pricing model
- [ ] Run hedging vs unhedged P&L analysis
- [ ] Add sensitivity and risk metrics
